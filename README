EZComment is a Vim global plugin for manipulating comments
in code.  It tries to both very flexible and very easy to
use.  EZComment provides mappings for two general kinds of
tasks: inserting and editing text comments, and
commenting/uncommenting actual code.

Use and customization of EZComment is discussed in detail in
the provided help file.  Here is the quick start information
(from the documentation):

-------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some -very- brief hints about the mappings to get
started quickly.  The mappings try to remind you of standard
Vim commands, so just try them!  If something is not
obvious, then check the documentation for details.

From normal mode:
to make new comments |gca|, |gci|, |gco|, |gcO|
to edit comments |gcA|, |gcC|

From visual mode, or from normal mode followed by {motion}:
to comment code |gcc|
to uncomment code |gcuc|
